# Healthcare Chatbot

The subject of our end of year project was to develop a "Chatbot to assist sick
people" which aims to implement an easy to handle web application so that the
user can have useful information (emergency numbers, hospital numbers, list of
pharmacies on duty in their city), follow his condition with the doctor and create
his list of medications.
To create the web application, we used Python, PyTorch, NLTK for the machine learning and the Natural Language Processing of the chatbot and Flask, HTML,
CSS and JavaScript for the front-end and MySQL for the back-end.
